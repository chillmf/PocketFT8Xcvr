## PocketFT8V210.bmp
Output spectrum under modulation ("CQ KQ7B DN15") with rig operating at 7074 kHz.  The 2nd harmonic is lost in the noise, the 3rd is ~50dB down, subsequent harmonics are lost in the noise.  The analyzer was scanning from DC-50 mHz, 5 mHz/division, with a bandwidth of 100 kHz.

## NarrowView.bmp
Narrow view of the output spectrum during modulation ("CQ KQ7B DN15") with rig operating at 7074 kHz + 888Hz for the FT8 offset .  The analyzer is scanning from 7074 to 7076 kHz, centered at 7075 kHz with a 30 Hz bandwidth.  At -30 dB down, emission products extend from ~7074.650 to 7075.050 Hz.

## TuningCarrier.bmp
Narrow view of the output specturm from the steady tuning carrier at 7074 kHz.  The analyzer is scanning from 7074 to 7076 kHz with a 30 Hz bandwidth.  We are likely viewing the combined phase noise performance of the transmitter and the Rigol DSA 815.  At ~200 Hz above the carrier, the noise is ~45 dB down.  This is probably the optimal measurement of the rig with the DSA 815, a baseline for comparison to the narrow view during modulation.
