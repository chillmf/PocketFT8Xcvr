## PocketFT8on40M.bmp
Output spectrum from Tune mode on 40 meter Pocket FT8 V2.00 using a 5-pole ChebyShev filter with 1 dB of ripple.  The transmitter is terminated in a ~50 Ohm dummy load equipped with a sample probe.  Absolute output power readings are for the probe, not for the transmitter PA.  The relative readings for the 2nd, 3rd and 5th harmonic represent their suppression.
